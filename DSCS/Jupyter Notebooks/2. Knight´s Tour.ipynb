This intriguing problem is often referred to as a \"knight's tour,\" which involves a sequence of knight moves on the chessboard. The objective is for the knight to land on each square exactly once during its journey, without revisiting any square."

    "\n",
    "In this context, the state is represented by the knight's position on the chessboard. To manage this state, we've created an object called **Knight_state**. It's characterized by the knight's x position and y position on the chessboard. Additionally, we've included the parent node as one of its attributes.\n",

    "In this code walkthrough, we delved into the realm of informed search trees and the A* search algorithm to tackle the intriguing problem of the knight's tour on a chessboard. By defining the problem in terms of states, calculating costs using an evaluation function, and efficiently exploring neighboring states, we were able to discover the optimal path for the knight to visit every square on the chessboard without revisiting any. The A* search strategy, combined with well-crafted functions and careful exploration, led us to a satisfying solution. This exercise serves as a great example of problem-solving and algorithmic thinking in the context of a classic chess puzzle."
